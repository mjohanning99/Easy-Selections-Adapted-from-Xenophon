      <p>THE object of such adapted Selections as these has some- times been misunderstood. It has been supposed that the aim is to save boys’ thought ; the real aim is the reverse. It is to get boys to think and to use their minds on the language at a stage when otherwise they would either have had their attention confined to Grammar or Delectus- work, or have had to struggle at translating authors whose style is really beyond them. Such a struggle does not, I believe, educate the boy or make him think. He is simply baffled and bewildered by having too many difficulties thrust on him at once, and either buys a word for word translation, or simply looks out the words without trying to connect them and discover a meaning. The essence of good teaching seems to me to lie in presenting to boys an infinite succession of problems carefully graduated according to the exact stage of their progress. Power is what we-’want ; and the feeling of getting on, the feeling of doing something with one’s knowledge, the pleasure of following a connected story all this awakens interest, makes brain and heart work with eye and ear, in- telligence with memory, and gives in fact that sense of power which is one of the chief sources of power itself.</p>
      <p>These ’ Easy Selections ’ are adapted for boys who are only just beginning Greek. They are somewhat graduated, so that the beginning is made still easier than the rest ; in the first hundred lines there are no augmented tenses, in the first three hundred none which are not specially explained in the notes. All through, the words are, as far as possible, put in the order in which they should be taken ; the sentences are very short, and there is a Vocabulary containing not only all the words, but all the more difficult forms of words used.</p>
      <p>The whole is intended as a Preliminary Part to ’ Selections Adapted from Xenophon 1 ,’ which has now reached a third edition. Since those ’ Selections ’ were published I have been so much engaged with other work that I should never have been able to complete this Preliminary Part without the welcome assistance of Mr. Jerram, who I found had already prepared an edition of the Anabasis on his own account. At my suggestion he kindly gave up this for an ’ Adapted ’ edition, to act as a First Greek Construing-book. Besides his knowledge of the Anabasis, he brought to the work the freshest acquaintance with the actual wants of boys beginning Greek, from his experience in directing the classical teaching of a large preparatory school. Though I am responsible for the plan of the book, the main burden of the work has fallen on his shoulders, and if these ’ Easy Selections ’ should in any way meet the wants of teachers, I hope the credit will be given where it is due. We owe thanks to Mr. Beuttler for preparing the first draught of the Vocabulary.</p>

      <p>THE principal change in the Second Edition is that the First Chapter has been made still easier than before. This improvement has been effected, not by altering the text (which might have caused inconvenience in schools where the former Edition was already in use), but by additions to the notes. The verb-forms are the great stumbling- block to beginners, and throughout the first 300 lines every such form likely to cause any difficulty has been ‘parsed.’ The aim of these Easy Selections is to enable a boy to begin construing at once, without the intervention of any Greek Reader or Delectus. At the request of the boys themselves the book was introduced into a form, where many had begun their Greek Grammar but two or three weeks previously ; and the experiment was found thoroughly suc- cessful. Should it^be thought that a reading-book is out of place at so early a stage, it must be remembered that by the time boys begin Greek, the chief difficulties of trans- lation from a foreign language have been already mastered in Latin, if not in French as well. With Grammar and Vocabulary a boy can begin construing almost as soon as he knows the alphabet. The need of constant reference to the Accidence to help him in this task makes an intelligent boy look upon his Grammar as a friend rather than as a foe ; whereas, if he learns paradigms alone for several weeks or months, he soon loses the interest of novelty in disgust at the dryness of the method. The standard of accuracy need not be lowered, but the required amount of accuracy may be achieved as completely with a more ready coopera- tion on the part of the learner. After all, we educate non scholae sect vitae; and if, as we profess, our chief aim is to develope intelligence, we cannot afford to dispense with the exercise of it at any stage.</p>
      <p>The First Edition was not stereotyped, on purpose to leave room for alterations. Several minor additions are now intro- duced, and the whole has been most carefully revised and corrected. Should any errata still have escaped detection, the Editors will be greatly obliged to any one who will send a line to either of them.</p>
