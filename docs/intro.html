        <b>What is this project?</b> <i>Easy Selections Adapted from Xenophon</i> is one of my currently ongoing project involving the digitisation of the book of the same name. It was published in 1878 — if the preface is to be taken as an accurate publication date — and is, thus, no longer copyrighted. This allows me to simply copy the text without any alterations. I have seen this been recommended to me previously, but unfortunately, only scanned copies exist on the Internet Archive and whilst that surely is better than nothing, it is still rather annoying. Therefore, I decided to begin copying the text and its notes using the tools and templates created by <i>Seumas MacDonald</i>. His project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/seumasjeltzz/LinguaeGraecaePerSeIllustrata">GitHub</a>.

        <b>What is this book?</b> This book's main intention was to give those students who have only recently begun their study of Ancient Greek an easy way to immediately begin reading texts. The original — i. e. unadapted — versions of Xenophon's texts are, indeed, on the simpler side for Ancient Greek; but they, nonetheless, may be too difficult for beginners and thus, this book aims to help beginners get a better grasp of the language by reading an original text, slightly adapated to better suit the beginner. The preface of the first edition gives some further inside as to why this book was written.
